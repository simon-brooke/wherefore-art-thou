# Introduction to wherefore-art-thou

Works of fiction -- and particularly video games -- require huge numbers of names for characters. If you're setting your story in a modern context you can probably just take the hundred most common male and female personal names, and the hundred most common surnames, from the location which is your setting and permutate from there, in which case you don't need this.

But if you're going for a fantasy setting, generating names becomes a chore. And [The Great Game](https://github.com/simon-brooke/the-great-game) is going to need hundreds of thousands of character names, which means it's a chore which needs to be automated.

This library is an attempt to automate the generation of names.
